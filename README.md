This repo exists to use GitHub's [wiki](https://github.com/codeforatlanta/wiki/wiki) feature. No other files will be committed.

The purpose of this wiki is to document the processes and practices of Code for Atlanta. We're leaving this open so that others can learn from it, but it will link to resources that may only be accessible to the leadership team of Code for Atlanta.
